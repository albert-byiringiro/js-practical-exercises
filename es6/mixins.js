EXTENSION: Mixins
Mixins are a tool in object-oriented programming that allows objects to be given methods and properties beyond those provided by their inheritance. For this challenge, complete the missing code, giving all of the robotMixin properties to robotFido. Do this in a single line of code, without adding the properties individually.

robotFido.speak() // -> Logs "I am made of metal"
